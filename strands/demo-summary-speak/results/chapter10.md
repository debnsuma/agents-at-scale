# Summary of Chapter 10: The Human Eye and the Colourful World

Chapter 10 explores the human eye as a complex optical system. It describes the eye's structure (cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina) and its camera-like functioning. The chapter explains accommodation - the eye's ability to adjust focal length to see objects at different distances. It details three common vision defects: myopia (nearsightedness), corrected with concave lenses; hypermetropia (farsightedness), corrected with convex lenses; and presbyopia (age-related vision decline). The chapter also mentions cataracts and how bifocal lenses can address multiple vision problems simultaneously.
